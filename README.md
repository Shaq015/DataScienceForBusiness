# Data Science for Business – Department-Level Case Studies

This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the Udemy course [Data Science for Business | 6 Real-world Case Studies](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-for-business-6-real-world-case-studies/).  
Each notebook represents a data-driven business case study focused on a specific department within an organization.

The goal is to leverage data science to support business decisions across key functional areas such as HR, Marketing, Sales, and more.
